<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Jasman Singh, a passionate individual with a blend of academic focus, sportsmanship, and an eye for luxury. I’m currently pursuing my studies at UPES, where I started in August 2023.</p>

<h2>A Little About My Journey:</h2>
<h3>Sports Enthusiast:</h3> <p>Basketball isn’t just a sport for me; it’s a lifestyle. I’m proud to represent the UPES basketball team in inter-university tournaments. Back in school, I managed and organized basketball tournaments, which instilled in me a strong sense of leadership and teamwork.</p>
<h3>HR Intern at an NGO:</h3> <p>My internship experience allowed me to nurture my skills in communication and management. From conducting interviews and hiring volunteers to teaching children and participating in plantation drives, I’ve embraced opportunities to make a positive impact.</p>
<h3>Tech-Savvy Creator:</h3> <p>I developed a terminal-based movie recommendation system that tailors suggestions based on genre, time limit, and IMDb ratings. It’s my way of combining creativity with problem-solving.</p>
<h2>My Personality:</h2>
<p>Fast, quick, and a multitasker—qualities that resonate on and off the court. I strive to approach life with a luxurious touch, appreciating the finer details while staying grounded and goal-oriented.

When I’m not studying, playing basketball, or coding, you’ll find me exploring new ideas, spending quality time with loved ones, and challenging myself to grow every day.

Let’s connect and create something extraordinary together!</p>
